# **App Name**: ReturnFlow

## Core Features:

- Return Initiation API: Expose an API endpoint that allows users to initiate a return with order ID and reason.
- Order Validation: Validate the order ID against an external system via a tool call to determine if it exists and is eligible for return.
- Return Processing: Process the return request, generating a return label and sending confirmation to the user.
- Status Notification: Provide a return initiation status.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2962FF) for trust and reliability.
- Background color: Light blue (#E6F0FF), a lighter shade of the primary color, desaturated to provide a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Orange (#FF9100), analogous to the primary color to highlight important actions.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, to ensure clarity and modern aesthetics.
- Use minimalist icons to represent different return reasons and status updates.
- Clean and structured layout for easy readability.
- Subtle animations for loading states and confirmation messages to improve UX.
